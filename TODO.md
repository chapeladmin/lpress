This is not a comprehensive list, just some things to be thought through at this time.

# User Management
*  Move site scope from group assigment to user record to avoid overstep.
   *  Will need to allow email addresses and username duplication in user table but restrict to one per site.
   *  Schema update.
*  New users should be global subscribers by default, so set that up for doing after saving for create action only.
*  Figure out how we want to handle avatars for the subscribing user form. Perhaps subscribers get a default avatar only.
*  Group assigments.

# Group Management
*  Permission assignments.

# Permission Management

# Record Management
*  Customize create/edit pages based on record fields.
*  Mass author/publisher reassignment for when desiring to force delete user.

# Value Management
*  Ability to schedule?
*  What happens when published user is force deleted?
