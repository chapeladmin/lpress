This Sword font was generated by passing the SIL font Gentium (basic regular, basic bold, basic italic, basic bold italic) family through Fontsquirrel and is thus considered a derivative work. Additionally the name gentium was removed from the generated svg files. The original font and license is available inside the included gentium-basic.zip. In accordance with the license, this derivative work is also bound to said license, though I am not claiming a registered name for this work.
